# I'm Sean Brown!

I am a Master of Data Science (MDS) student at the University of British Columbia, building on a BSc in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University (2024).

I’m interested in applied machine learning and ML research, especially work that blends strong modeling with solid engineering, reproducible pipelines, and measurable impact.

## What I do
- Build end-to-end ML projects, from raw data → clean pipelines → trained models → evaluation → reporting
- Focus on reproducibility, maintainable code, and real-world usability
- Enjoy projects involving messy data, feature engineering, and thoughtful validation

## Experience
**Software Developer Intern — Harris Computer (Cayenta)**  
Worked on full-stack development and contributed to AI-powered features in a production environment. This strengthened my ability to ship maintainable systems built for real users, not just demos.

## Featured work
- **Income Prediction Pipeline (Census Data)**  
  Fully reproducible ML workflow including ingestion, cleaning, training, evaluation, and reporting.
- **Chess Elo Prediction from PGN Notation**  
  Unstructured text modeling with parsing, feature engineering, and careful validation.
- **LLM Fine-tuning & Evaluation**  
  Fine-tuned a GPT-based chatbot and explored evaluation beyond single-metric performance.
