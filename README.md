# 👋 I'm Sean Brown!

I’m a Master of Data Science (MDS) student at the University of British Columbia, and I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University (2024).

I’m interested in applied machine learning and ML research, especially work that connects real-world problems to strong technical solutions and measurable impact.

I’m as excited by ML innovation as I am by the engineering behind it. I’m always on the lookout for new, practical ways to apply AI.

## 🛠️ What I do
- Build end-to-end ML projects, from raw data → clean pipelines → trained models → evaluation → reporting
- Focus on reproducibility, maintainable code, and real-world usability
- Enjoy projects involving messy data, feature engineering, and thoughtful validation

## 🚀 Featured work
- **Income Prediction Pipeline (Census Data)**  
  Fully reproducible ML workflow including ingestion, cleaning, training, evaluation, and reporting.
- **Chess Elo Prediction from PGN Notation**  
  Unstructured text modeling with parsing, feature engineering, and careful validation.
- **LLM Fine-tuning & Evaluation**  
  Fine-tuned a GPT-based chatbot and explored evaluation beyond a single metric.

## 📍 Currently
- Finishing my Master of Data Science at UBC (grad: June 2026)
- Actively seeking internship + entry-level roles in Data Science / Machine Learning
- Building ML projects that prioritize reproducibility, clean pipelines, and real evaluation

## More about me
Outside of ML, you’ll usually find me:
- 🎸 Playing and writing music, I’ve loved it since I was a kid and still love jamming with friends
- 🏔️ Staying active, skiing in the winter, hiking and golfing in the summer
- 🎬 Watching movies and geeking out over cinema and TV
